# Intruction on how rto compile the file.
In order to compile and run the software, you simply need to download the file to your document,
unzip it if needed, save it to your device and run it using 
visual studio code.

# Changes made based on the lecturer feedback
Added a notification box that notifies the user when the recipe calories is above 300, if the calories is under 300 the 
notification tells the user that the recipe is healthy, and if it exceed 300 it notifies the user that the recipe is above the 
calorie limit and take the user back to the main page to enter a new recipe

I added a save button that allows to capture the user's input before proceeding to the next step and if the user 
does not save his input the details will not be captured and will not be displayed on the recipe unless saved.
A user is allowed to enter as many recipe and ingredients needed as possible as long as he/she saves them.
